	 * this built-in at the corresponding position. Substitutes where this built-in 
	 * already has a constant might be ignored.

	 * The returned tuple contains the calculated substitutions for the

	 * constants) in the built-in in the order their variables
	 * appear in the built-in. If there are no variables left to calculate
	 * the built-in will check the correctness of the terms and return a
	 * tuple containing all constants if it is correct, otherwise
	 * <code>null</code>.
	 * For example if you evaluate 
	 * <code>4 + X = 9</code> you would get back <code>&lt;5&gt;</code>. 
	 * The only difference are the binary built-ins: For a binary built-in 
	 * if you try to evaluate <code>3 &lt; 4</code> you will get back 
	 * <code>&lt;3, 4&gt;</code>, but if you try to evaluate <code>3 &lt; 2</code> 
	 * you will get back <code>null</code>.
