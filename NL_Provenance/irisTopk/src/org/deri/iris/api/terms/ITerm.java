 * <p>
 * An interface which defines a term. A term is a name for an object
 * in the universe of discourse. There are three types of terms:
 * <ul>
 * <li> variables</li>
 * <li> constants</li>
 * <li> constructed terms (functional symbols)</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * By convention <code>null</code> is the smalles possible term of all types.
 * So if you compare a term using the compare method you will always recieve
 * a positive number.
