 * Used to classify nodes.

 * LINK		A link node which is a special form of a memo node.
 * 			A link node is not evaluated by resolution, but 
 * 			previously computed answers are used to expand the node.
 * 			By trying to expand the link node using resolution,
 * 			the node gets paused.
 * 			
 * ANSWER	A answer node which is a special form of a memo node.
 * 			A answer node is evaluated by resolution. The answers
 * 			are stored in the corresponding entry in the memo table.
 * 
 * NORMAL	A ordinary node (not a memo node).
